## **Flask Application Design**

### **Problem Analysis**

> (Provide a concise summary of the web application problem.)

### **Flask Application Structure**

1. **HTML Files:**
    - `index.html`: The main HTML file where users interact with the application.
    - `about.html`: Provides information about the application and its developers.
    - `contact.html`: Allows users to contact the application's team with queries or feedback.

2. **Routes:**

    - `/`: Renders the home page (`index.html`).
    - `/about`: Renders the about page (`about.html`).
    - `/contact`: Handles user contact form submissions, sending an email to the developers.

### **HTML Files**

**index.html:**

- Contains the main user interface elements for interacting with the application.
- May include sections for tasks, updates, progress tracking, and more.

**about.html:**

- Provides information about the application's purpose, features, and development team.
- Can include contact details for the developers.

**contact.html:**

- Contains a form with fields for user information (name, email) and a message text area.
- Handles form submission, validating the data and sending an email to the developers.

### **Routes**

**`@app.route('/')`:**

- Renders the home page (`index.html`) when a user accesses the application's root URL.

**`@app.route('/about')`:**

- Renders the about page (`about.html`) when a user navigates to the "/about" URL.

**`@app.route('/contact', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`:**

- Handles both GET and POST requests.
- GET displays the contact form (`contact.html`).
- POST handles form submissions, validates the data, and sends an email to the developers.
